# Insights from City Supply and Demand Data

## Overview

Welcome to the Uber City Supply and Demand Analysis repository! This project aims to unravel insights from the provided dataset, shedding light on the dynamics between supply and demand in a city environment. As a seasoned data scientist with over 20 years of experience, I have delved into the dataset to address critical questions related to completed trips, customer requests, and the overall balance between supply and demand.

## Objective

The primary objective is to provide comprehensive answers to key questions outlined in three sections: Completed Trips, Requests and Zeroes, and Supply & Demand + True or False. The analysis covers a two-week period, offering valuable insights for optimizing operations and understanding patterns in the city's Uber ecosystem.

### Key Questions Explored

#### Section 1: Completed Trips

1. __Most Completed Trips__
   + Identify the date with the highest number of completed trips during the two-week period
2. __Highest Daily Completed Trips__
   + Determine the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hours period
3. __Weighted Average Ratio__
   + Calculate the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver over the two weeks

#### Section 2: Requests and Zeroes
1. Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
2. What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)? 
3. In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hours shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift          starts in every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work same shift each day.

#### Section 3: Supply & Demand + True or False
1. Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both        their natural minimums)
2. In which 72 hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
3. If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to? 
4. True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
5. True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period.
