# Insights from City Supply and Demand Data ðŸš—

## Overview

Welcome to the Uber City Supply and Demand Analysis repository! This project aims to unravel insights from the provided dataset, shedding light on the dynamics between supply and demand in a city environment. The purpose is to dive into the dataset to address critical questions related to completed trips, customer requests, and the overall balance between supply and demand.

## Objective

The primary objective is to provide comprehensive answers to key questions outlined in three sections: Completed Trips, Requests and Zeroes, and Supply & Demand + True or False. The analysis covers a two-week period, offering valuable insights for optimizing operations and understanding patterns in the city's Uber ecosystem.

## Key Questions Explored

### __Section 1: Completed Trips__

1. __Most Completed Trips__
   + Identify the date with the highest number of completed trips during the two-week period
2. __Highest Daily Completed Trips__
   + Determine the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hours period
3. __Weighted Average Ratio__
   + Calculate the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver over the two weeks

### __Section 2: Requests and Zeroes__

1. __Peak Request Hour__
   + Identify the hour of the day with the highest number of requests during the two-week period
2. __Weekend Zeroes Percentage__
   + Determine the percentage of zeroes occurring on weekends (Friday 5pm to Sunday 3 am)
3. __Busiest 8 Consecutive Hours__
   + Define the busiest 8 consecutive hours in terms of unique requests, considering an 8-hour shift

### __Section 3: Supply & Demand + True or False__

1. __Natural "End Day" Time__
   + Identify the time that might make the most sense to consider as a true "end day" instead of midnight, based on supply and demand patterns
2. __Peak Zeroes to Eyeballs Ratio__
   + Determine the 72-hour period with the highest ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs
3. __Optimal Hour for Adding Drivers__
   + If adding 5 drivers to any single hour daily, identify the optimal hour for maximizing impact
4. __True or False Statements__
   + Confirm or refute statements regarding the duration of data analysis and the relationship between driver supply and demand fluctuations
  
### Data Description

The dataset includes crucial metrics such as Date, Time (Local), Eyeballs, Zeroes, Completed Trips, Requests, and Unique Drivers. Understanding the nuances of these metrics is essential for deriving actionable insights.
